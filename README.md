# AgroSmart - Smart Crop Advisory System üå±
An AI-powered, all-in-one platform to empower small and marginal farmers with data-driven agricultural advice.

This project is a fully-functional web application prototype developed for the Smart India Hackathon, based on the problem statement "Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers".

üéØ The Problem
Small and marginal farmers in India often rely on traditional knowledge, which can lead to guesswork in crop selection, pest control, and fertilization. This results in:

Poor crop yields and lower income.

High input costs due to inefficient use of resources.

Lack of personalized advice due to language barriers and low digital literacy.

Limited access to market data and government support schemes.

‚ú® The Solution: AgroSmart
AgroSmart is a multilingual, voice-enabled, and AI-powered web application that acts as a personal farming companion. It provides hyper-personalized, real-time guidance to farmers, helping them make informed decisions at every stage of the farming lifecycle.

The platform is designed to be an "All-in-One" solution, combining farm management, market services, and a community platform into a single, easy-to-use interface.

üöÄ Key Features
The app includes a comprehensive suite of features to address every need of a modern farmer:
